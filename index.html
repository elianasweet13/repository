  <p> I am a strategic communication major with a Creative Technology Design minor.
    I am from Orange County, California and as much as I love
    the beach I chose CU Boulder to experience a different environment
    and to have the beautiful view of the mountains.</p>
  <p> I am so excited to see what i do after attending the <strong>University
    of  Colorado Boulder</strong></p>
